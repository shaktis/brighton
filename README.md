# Brighton Tech Challenge

## Setup instructions
1. Pre-requisites -- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Clone repo
    ```shell
       git clone git@github.com:shaktis/brighton.git
       cd brighton
    ```
3. Create a `.env` file with feed URL.  
    ```shell
       cp .env.example .env
    ```
4. Build and launch the app and tail logs 
    ```shell
       docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d && docker logs -f --tail 10 brighton-app-1 
    ```
5. The application logs will display store counts by state as well as create a static HTML file as required by the tech challenge. See screenshots below.

## Application structure 
### 1-Backend 
A `python`/`flask` backend with an entry point located in [manage.py](manage.py) `Line 3`.

`Lines 29-32` in [app.py](brighton/app.py) display the store counts by state and create the static HTML file.

`StoreService` in [services.py](brighton/services.py) is a service fa√ßade for the backend operations required to complete the task. 

### 2-Front-end
[brighton/templates/stores.html](brighton/templates/stores.html) contains the required HTML and CSS for the front-end. It is defined as a Jinja2 template, the templating system used by the `flask` framework.

### 3-Database
The recommended database definition for storing data returned by the feed is provided in [sql/ddl.sql](sql/ddl.sql) 

### 4-DevOps
Docker related files are [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and [DockerFile](DockerFile) and Kubernetes related config is provided in [k8s/deployment.yml](k8s/deployment.yml)
